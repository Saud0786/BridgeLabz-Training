---

### 🗓 Day 5 – OOPs Inheritance (All types)  
**Date: 31-Dec-2025**

- **Inheritance**
  - Mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class.
  - Promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification.

- **Single Level Inheritance**
  - One subclass inherits from one superclass.
  - Example: `Child → Parent`

- **Multilevel Inheritance**
  - A class is derived from another derived class.
  - Example: `Grandchild → Child → Parent`

- **Hierarchical Inheritance**
  - Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
  - Example: `Child1 → Parent`, `Child2 → Parent`

- **Key Features of Inheritance**
  - Code reusability  
  - Method overriding  
  - Runtime polymorphism  
  - Improved maintainability  
  - Extensibility  

- **Method Overriding**
  - Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.
  - Achieved using the same method signature.

- **Constructor Inheritance in Java**
  - Constructors are **not inherited**.
  - Parent class constructor is invoked using `super()` keyword.

- **Polymorphism and Inheritance**
  - Inheritance enables runtime polymorphism.
  - Method calls are resolved based on object type, not reference type.

- **Access Modifiers and Inheritance**
  - `public` → Accessible everywhere  
  - `protected` → Accessible within package and subclasses  
  - `default` → Accessible within the same package  
  - `private` → Not accessible in subclasses  

 **Solved Many problem and push on github**
