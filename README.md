## 📅 Week 3 – Day 1: Data Structures (Linked Lists)  
**📆 Date:** 2 January 2026  

---

### 🔹 Topics Covered

- Introduction of Data Structures  
- Key Features of Data Structures in Java  
- Types of Data Structures in Java  
### Singly Linked List
- Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- Traversal is possible only in one direction.
- Efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays.
  
### Doubly Linked List 
- Each node contains data, previous, and next references.
- Traversal is possible in both forward and backward directions.
- Requires extra memory due to additional pointer.
  
### Circular Linked List  
- Last node points back to the first node.
- No NULL references in the list.
- Useful in applications like circular queues and scheduling.

### ✅ Practice Summary
- Solved **multiple problems** based on Linked List concepts  
- Practiced operations such as:
  - Insertion and deletion
  - Traversal techniques
  - Understanding node structure and pointers  
- Strengthened understanding of linear data structures  
- Focused on problem-solving and logical implementation

## Day 2: Stack, Queue & Hashing  
**📆 Date:** 4 January 2026  

### 🔹 Topics Covered

- **Stack**
  - Linear data structure following LIFO (Last In First Out)
  - Operations: push, pop, peek
  - Used in function calls, expression evaluation, and undo operations

- **Queue**
  - Linear data structure following FIFO (First In First Out)
  - Operations: enqueue, dequeue, front
  - Used in scheduling, buffering, and resource management

- **HashMap & Hashing Function**
  - HashMap stores data in key–value pairs
  - Hashing function converts keys into hash codes
  - Enables fast insertion, deletion, and searching
  - Handles collisions using techniques like chaining

### ✅ Practice Summary
- Solved **multiple problems** based on Stack and Queue operations  
- Practiced usage of HashMap for efficient data storage and retrieval  
- Understood working of hashing functions and collision handling  
- Focused on time complexity and performance optimization
