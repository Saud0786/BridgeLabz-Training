## 📅 Week 3 – Day 1: Data Structures (Linked Lists)  
**📆 Date:** 2 January 2026  

---

### 🔹 Topics Covered

- Introduction of Data Structures  
- Key Features of Data Structures in Java  
- Types of Data Structures in Java  
### Singly Linked List
- Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- Traversal is possible only in one direction.
- Efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays.
  
### Doubly Linked List 
- Each node contains data, previous, and next references.
- Traversal is possible in both forward and backward directions.
- Requires extra memory due to additional pointer.
  
### Circular Linked List  
- Last node points back to the first node.
- No NULL references in the list.
- Useful in applications like circular queues and scheduling.
